    Contribution Game - Overview
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
	At the beginning of each round, each group member will start out with an endowment of {{base_tokens}} tokens. <!-- Thus, the group will have a total of {{total_tokens}} tokens ({{base_tokens}} tokens x {{group_size}} group members) in each round.-->  <br><br>

	In each round, you have to decide on the allocation of your {{base_tokens}} tokens. You can either keep your {{base_tokens}} tokens to yourself or you can contribute all or some of it between the two Group Accounts (Group Account A and Group Account B). <br><br>

	You can only contribute to these group accounts in increments of {{increment}} token. <br><br>

	In each round, you and your group member will face the same decision. <b>However, in each round, you will randomly be re-matched with {{other_part}} other participant.</b> <br><br>

  {% formfields %}

	At the end of each round, you will receive feedback on the total contributions to each group account and your earnings in that round. <br><br>
