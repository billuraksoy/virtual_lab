	Contribution Game – Earnings from Group Accounts
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
	Each group member can contribute any of their endowment of {{base_tokens}} tokens to one or both of the group accounts. Each group account will generate a return for the group members <u>if and only if</u> the number of tokens allocated to each group account is greater than or equal to its pre-specified number that is called “threshold”.<br><br>

	<h5>Group Account A:</h5>

	The threshold for Group Account A is <b>{{threshold_high}} tokens</b>. <br> <br>

	{% if threshold_high == total_tokens %} <!-- (if threshold_high is the maximum contribution don't say "at least") -->
		If the total amount contributed by your group to Group Account A is {{threshold_high}} tokens, <u>each</u> group member will earn <b>{{value_high}} tokens</b> from this account. Otherwise, nobody earns any tokens from this account.<br> <br>
	{% else %}
		If the total amount contributed by your group to Group Account A is at least {{threshold_high}} tokens, <u>each</u> group member will earn <b>{{value_high}} tokens</b> from this account. Otherwise, nobody earns any tokens from this account.<br> <br>
	{% endif %}


	<br><h5>Group Account B: </h5>

	The threshold for Group Account B is <b>{{threshold_low}} tokens</b>. <br><br>

	If the total amount contributed by your group to Group Account B is at least {{threshold_low}} tokens, <u>each</u> group member will earn <b>{{value_low}} tokens</b> from this account. Otherwise, nobody earns any tokens from this account.<br><br>
