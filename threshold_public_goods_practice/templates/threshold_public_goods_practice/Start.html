	<p>Thanks for completing the practice round. Now the actual Contribution Game will start and you will be matched with a different participant in each round.</p>

  <p>You will have to submit your decisions within {{decision_timer}} seconds.  This is to ensure that this online study proceeds smoothly. If you fail to make your decision on time, the computer will make a random decision on your behalf and you will be removed from the study. If this happens, you will <u>not</u> receive payment from this study.</p>

	<p>It is <u>highly unlikely</u> that your group member times out and gets removed from the study. However, if this rare situation occurs, we will inform you on the round summary page. </p>

  Remember that once you start, you will have {{decision_timer}} seconds to submit your decisions.<br><br>
