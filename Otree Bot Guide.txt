Otree Bot Guide

Preface
Otree bots allow for incredible levels of testing and automatic interaction with otree pages. I’d recommend reading up on their documentation here: https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/bots.html
This guide will assume you have already read it and will cover some important notes about using bots as well as some important use cases.

Generator objects

Bots in python are driven by python generator objects; when the “play_round” function is called, it returns a generator that points back to itself. 
The bot driver code on the server side will repeatedly ask the generator object for responses to each page the bot lands on, and the generator object 
will respond by resuming the code it points to where it last left off and continuing until the next yield or pass statement, pausing when it gets there.

So if you had:
class PlayerBot(Bot):
    def play_round(self):
        somevar=”Hi”
        yield pages.First, dict(number=1)
        print(somevar)
        yield pages.Second
        somevar=”Hello”
        print(somevar)
        yield pages.Third

On the first page, nothing would print, but a field called “number” would be set to 1. 
On the second page, “Hi” would be printed to the console and no fields would be set. 
On the third page “Hello” would be printed to the console and no fields would be set.

This means that if you want the bot to do something on every page, say take a screenshot for example, they would have to be told to do it before every 
yield or pass statement.
