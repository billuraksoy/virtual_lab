    In the following pages, you will be presented with a series of statements that may or may not be true for you. The statements will be about yourself and your views on social issues. And we will ask you <strong>how many</strong> of those statements are true for you.

<p>
We do not want to know which specific statements are true for you. Instead, we just want to know <strong>how many</strong> of those statements shown on the screen are true for you.
</p>

<b> There is no way for us to know which specific statements are true for you. We will only know how many of them are true for you.</b>
