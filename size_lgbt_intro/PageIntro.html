<h3><strong>
Instructions
</strong></h3>


<p>
    In the following pages, you will be presented with lists of statements that may or may not be true for you. The statements will be about yourself and your views on social issues. And we will ask you <strong>how many</strong> of those statements in each list are true for you.
</p>

<!--
<p>
We do not want to know which specific statements are true for you. Instead, we just want to know <strong>how many</strong> of those statements shown on the screen are true for you.
</p>
-->

<p>
<b> Please note that there is no way for us to know which specific statements in these lists are true for you: we will only know how many of them are true for you. </b>
</p>




<p> On the following page, we will give you an example. Please click next when you are ready.
