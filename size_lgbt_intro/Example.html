<i>We want to be sure that you understand how this works. Here is what it will look like on your screen as an example:</i>

<br>
<br>


There are three statements listed below. We would like to know how many of them are true for you.
<br>
<br>
-	I own an orange t-shirt.<br>
-	My household has at least four pets.<br>
-	I regularly recycle. <br>
<br>

Please enter the total number of statements above that are true for you:
<div class="controls">
	<input type="number" class="form-control" value="" disabled="disabled">
</div>

<br>
<br>

<p>
<i> Suppose that you do own an orange t-shirt and your household has at least four pets. But you do not recycle. In that case, two of the above statements are true for you. Hence, you would indicate this by entering 2 in the answer box.   </i>
</p>

<p>
Please notice that you do not indicate which specific statements are true for you. Thus, we will only know <u>how many</u> of them are true for you.
</p>

Please click NEXT when you are ready.
