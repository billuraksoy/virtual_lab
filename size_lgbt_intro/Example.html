<i>We want to be sure that you understand how this works. Here is how your screen will look like:</i>


There are three statements listed below. We would like to know how many of them are true for you. We do not want to know which specific ones are true for you. Instead, we just want to know <strong>how many</strong> of the following statements are true for you.<br>
<br>
-	I own an orange t-shirt.<br>
-	My household has at least four pets.<br>
-	I regularly recycle. <br>
<br>

<div class="controls">
	<input type="number" class="form-control" value="2" disabled="disabled">
</div>

<p> 
<i> Suppose that you do own an orange t-shirt and your household has at least four pets. But you do not recycle. In that case, two of the above statements are true for you. Hence, you would indicate this by entering 2 in the answer box as shown above.  </i>
